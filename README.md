# Personal webpage 

This is a webpage I created to allow potential employers to get to know me, my journey and some of my current projects. I wanted to frame this experience as a real-world project in industry, so I started off by creating user personas, a draft site design/component tree and low/high-fidelity wireframes. This meant that every design decision was thoroughly though about and designed with a specific purpose - to allow the user to really get to know me AND have a nice user experience.
